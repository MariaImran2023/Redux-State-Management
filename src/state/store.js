import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; //configureStore: This is a function from @reduxjs/toolkit that helps you set up your Redux store with sensible defaults (it automatically includes a set of configurations and tools that are commonly needed for a typical Redux application.). 
import reducers from "./reducers"; //reducers: This is where you import all your reducers (functions that manage parts of your state).
import { thunk } from "redux-thunk" // thunk: Middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, useful for handling asynchronous logic like fetching data from an API.


const store = configureStore({
  reducer: reducers,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(thunk),
});
//middleware is a property where you can specify additional middleware for the Redux store. Middleware in Redux is like a pipeline that sits between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. It allows you to add custom functionality like logging, crash reporting, or handling asynchronous actions.

//getDefaultMiddleware is a function provided by @reduxjs/toolkit that returns an array of default middleware. These defaults include useful middleware like redux-thunk for handling asynchronous actions, redux-immutable-state-invariant for detecting mutations in the state, and others.

//concat is an array method that adds thunk to the array of default middleware.

export default store;

//EXPLANATION:
//This code creates a Redux store for managing the state of a React application. The `configureStore` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit` is used to set up the store with some default settings that make it easier to use Redux. It combines all the individual reducers (functions that determine how the state changes in response to actions) into a single root reducer. It also includes default middleware, which are tools that can intercept actions and add extra behavior, such as handling asynchronous actions with `redux-thunk`. By adding `thunk` middleware, the store can manage async operations like fetching data from an API. This store is then exported so it can be used throughout the application, ensuring state management is centralized and efficient.

//This code sets up a central place to manage all the data (state) for your React app using Redux.

//Reducers: It combines all the functions that update the data (called reducers).
//Middleware: It adds tools (middleware) to handle tasks like making API calls.
//Store: The configureStore function sets up this central place (store) with everything it needs.
//By doing this, your app can handle data changes and async tasks smoothly. The store is then ready to be used throughout your app to keep everything organized and working together.
